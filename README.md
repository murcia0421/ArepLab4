# Taller4_AREP: MicroSpring Framework

This project is a micro-framework in Java inspired by Spring Boot that enables you to build a minimal web server. The server:

- **Automatically scans** the classpath for classes annotated with `@RestController`.
- **Maps endpoints** using the `@GetMapping` annotation and resolves URL parameters with `@RequestParam`.
- **Serves static resources** (such as HTML and PNG files) from either the file system or the classpath (from `resources/static`).
- Includes a front-end example that consumes the `/greeting` endpoint.
- Implements caching in the `GreetingController` to store and reuse greetings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK 17** (or higher)  
  Download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
- **Apache Maven**  
  Download it from [Maven Official](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the installation instructions.
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)
- **Docker** (for containerization and deployment)
- **AWS CLI** (for AWS CodeBuild and deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/murcia0421/ArepLab4.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   
  ```bash
  cd ArepLab4
  ```

3. Compile and package the project with Maven:
   
  ```bash
  mvn clean package
  ```
4. Run the server:

  ```bash
  java -jar target/AREP3-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  ```

5. Check the console for messages such as:

  ```bash
  Registered: /greeting -> greeting
  Server running on port 8080...
   ```
## Project Architecture
